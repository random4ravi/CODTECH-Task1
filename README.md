## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

  ### PROJECT : The Simple Calculator

  It should prompt the user to enter two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication,

    b. The main function checks if the user's input is valid (i.e., one of the choices 1, 2, 3, 4,). If not, it prints "Invalid operation entered"

## RUN THE CODE :
  For writing and running the code,I used an IDE(vs code),a text editor with Python support
